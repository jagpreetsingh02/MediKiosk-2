/**
 * One product, four surfaces, one ground.
 *
 *   /          the hero — the front door, ported from `ui/`
 *   /intake    the kiosk (the patient's device)
 *   /physician the review workspace
 *   /demo      one-click synthetic cases for a jury
 *
 * They used to share the typed API client and nothing else, on the theory that a surface built
 * for a non-literate patient and one built for a time-pressed clinician want opposite things
 * from every component they might have in common. Half of that is still true and is why the
 * two surfaces run at different densities. The other half — that they should therefore *look*
 * unrelated — turned out to be wrong in practice: a patient who taps Start on the landing page
 * and lands somewhere that shares none of its colours, type or motion has, as far as they can
 * tell, been handed to a different piece of software mid-consultation. See ADR-0013.
 *
 * So everything below the router now sits on one ground and is built from one material.
 *
 * TWO THINGS ARE MOUNTED ABOVE `Routes`, AND BOTH HAVE TO BE:
 *
 *   `Ambient` — the background video. If each route rendered its own, every navigation would
 *   restart the footage from frame zero, and the ground would visibly cut. Mounted once, it
 *   simply never unmounts; it only changes depth. That single element is the strongest
 *   continuity cue in the product.
 *
 *   `ToastProvider` — already was, and stays: a toast raised by a commit must survive the
 *   navigation that follows it.
