/**
 * The same brief, for the person it is about.
 *
 * PATIENT CALM, not clinician density. `data-density="patient"` widens the shared scale — one
 * column, large type, generous spacing — because this is read standing up, possibly by someone
 * who has never used a kiosk, possibly by someone who cannot read quickly.
 *
 * GROUPED BY WHERE IT CAME FROM, not by clinical category. "What you told us" is a question a
 * patient can answer for themselves; "History of presenting illness" is not.
 *
 * ⛔ NOTHING HERE IS CLICKABLE INTO EVIDENCE, and that is deliberate rather than unfinished.
 * The provenance a patient needs is the group heading — these are your words, this came off
 * your paper — and a drawer full of ontology paths, tiers and confidence scores would be
 * showing them our bookkeeping rather than their record.
 *
 * The backend already strips every internal identifier (proved in
 * `tests/test_report_determinism.py` and again over the wire). This component adds nothing
 * back: it renders only `label` and `value`, both of which are plain language by construction.
