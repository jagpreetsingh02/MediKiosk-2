# Both halves of the schema, or Alembic silently emits half a database. `durable` was
# missing here, so the thirteen longitudinal tables — patient, encounter, clinical_fact and
# the rest — existed only because `create_all()` runs against SQLite at startup. On any real
# Postgres they would simply not have been created, and the patient memory would have been
# empty with nothing in the logs to say why.

#
# Alembic's DDL and its version-table bookkeeping want a real session on one backend
# connection. Supabase's transaction-mode pooler hands out a different backend per
# transaction and cannot carry prepared statements between them, so a migration run through
# it fails partway with `prepared statement "__asyncpg_stmt_N__" does not exist` — after
# some DDL has already committed, which is the worst possible place to stop.
#
# `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` exists for the deployment where the app runs pooled: point the
# app at the pooler and this at the direct endpoint. When it is unset (the normal case, and
# the case on this machine, where the direct IPv6 endpoint is reachable) migrations use the
# same URL as the app.
# When DEMO_LOCAL_DB is on, migrations follow the runtime to the local database — a demo
# database with no schema is not a fallback. MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL still wins for the
# Supabase case, where DDL wants the direct endpoint rather than the pooler.
