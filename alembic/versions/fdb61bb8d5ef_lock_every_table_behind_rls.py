"""Deny-by-default RLS on every table, because Supabase publishes the schema.

The thing that makes Supabase convenient is the thing that makes this necessary: PostgREST
serves every table in `public` over HTTPS, and the `anon` key that reaches it is *designed*
to be public — it ships in browser code. Without RLS, `GET /rest/v1/clinical_fact` returns
the ledger to anybody who has looked at the network tab. The database linter reports exactly
this, at ERROR level, for all twenty-three tables.

The model here is deliberately the blunt one:

    RLS enabled, and NO policies at all.

A table with RLS on and no policy denies every row to `anon` and `authenticated`. MediKiosk
does not want per-row rules in the database yet, because it has no real identity in the
database to write them against — the ABHA identity is a mock JWT verified by FastAPI, and
inventing a parallel Supabase Auth identity to satisfy a policy expression would create the
second, conflicting patient identity that the brief explicitly refuses (§5).

So the access model stays where the authorisation already lives:

    browser ──▶ FastAPI (ABAC + session ownership) ──▶ SQLAlchemy ──▶ Postgres

The backend connects as the owning role, which bypasses RLS, and every clinical read it
serves has already been through `require_action()` and `assert_session_access()`. RLS is not
the authorisation model; it is the wall that stops anyone going around the authorisation
model. `docs/SUPABASE_SECURITY.md` records how real patient and clinician claims would map
to policies when there is a real IdP to map them from.

This runs on PostgreSQL only. SQLite has no RLS and needs none — it is a local file used by
the tests, not a service listening on the internet.
