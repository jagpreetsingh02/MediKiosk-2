# AGENT.md — working on MediKiosk

Read this before changing anything. It is short on purpose; the long-form reasoning lives in
`docs/`.

MediKiosk is a patient-facing clinical intake platform for **SIH26047** (All India Institute of
Ayurveda, Ministry of Ayush). It produces a structured, source-linked clinical **history** for a
physician to review before an OPD consultation. **It does not diagnose.**

---

## The six invariants

These are architectural, not aspirational. Each is enforced in code, and each has a test that
fails the build if it is violated. **If a change conflicts with one of these, stop and raise it
rather than working around it.**

| # | Invariant | Where it is enforced | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Never diagnoses.** No endpoint returns an assessment, differential or probability. | `ClinicalHistory` has no assessment-shaped field; `assert_no_assessment()` scans every outbound payload | `test_invariant_no_diagnosis.py` |
| 2 | **Provenance or nothing.** Every fact carries the verbatim utterance or document span it came from, with a tier of `stated` / `confirmed` / `document`. There is no fourth tier. | `record_fact()` — the single writer | `test_invariant_provenance.py` |
| 3 | **Red flags escalate, never de-escalate.** | `Priority` has no member below `ROUTINE`; `raise_priority()` refuses a downward move | `test_summary_and_redflags.py` |
| 4 | **The physician is the committer.** | ABAC restricts `summary.commit` to `clinician`, *and* the body must carry `confirmed: true` | `test_api_end_to_end.py` |
| 5 | **Codes are retrieved, never generated.** Unmapped is a valid 200. | `emit_coding()` — the closed-vocabulary guard, ported from SIH 25026 | `test_api_end_to_end.py` |
| 6 | **Consent gates everything, and sessions die.** | `FactLedger.consent_scopes` + `purge()` on submit / TTL / revocation; every AI call hits the hash-chained audit log | `test_invariant_audit_chain.py` |

### The three things you must not do

1. **Do not add a bypass to `record_fact()`.** No `force=`, no `skip_validation=`, no
   `trust_me=`. A test asserts the signature has none. The absence is the feature.
2. **Do not construct a `Fact` outside `app/contracts/record.py`.** A source-scanning test
   fails the build if you do. (One exception exists and is documented: rehydrating a stored
   row in `app/api/deps.py`.)
3. **Do not let the LLM decide what to ask next.** The state machine walks
   `data/ontology/*.yaml` and nothing else.

---

## Rule or LLM?

The standing question for every new feature, and the answer goes in the commit message.

**The LLM has exactly two jobs.** Both are additive, both are verified, and neither can change
the shape of the record:

1. **Extract slot values from free narration** (`app/llm/extraction.py`). It must return a
   `quote`, and the quote is checked by string search against the actual transcript — not by
   asking the model whether it was honest. Four gates, then `record_fact()` re-checks
   independently.
2. **Smooth prose within a summary section** (`app/modules/summary/prose.py`). Output goes
   through the same token check; one unsupported word and the deterministic bullets are kept.

**Everything else is a rule**, including the parts that look like they want a model:

| Task | Why a rule | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Which question comes next | Reproducible, works offline, cannot skip the allergy question | `modules/dialogue/machine.py` |
| Emergency detection | A missed escalation is the only unacceptable error; rules are auditable by a clinician | `redflags/engine.py` + `data/ontology/redflags.yaml` |
| Prescription / lab parsing | A prescription line has a grammar; regex is exact, instant, and gives character offsets for the bbox | `modules/documents/entities.py` |
| Out-of-range flagging | A range comparison, not an interpretation | `modules/documents/ranges.py` |
| Summary assembly | Predictable structure is what makes a summary readable in 90 seconds | `modules/summary/assemble.py` |

---

## Content lives in YAML, not Python

A clinician must be able to change the interview without touching code. If you find yourself
writing a clinical string in a `.py` file, it belongs in `data/` instead.

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `data/ontology/core.yaml` | Chief complaint, SOCRATES HPI, PMH, surgical, drugs/allergy, family, personal |
| `data/ontology/ros.yaml` | Review of systems |
| `data/ontology/ayush.yaml` | Dashavidha Pariksha + Ahara-Vihara, each answer naming a code |
| `data/ontology/redflags.yaml` | The 22 escalation rules |
| `data/ontology/lexicon.yaml` | Phrase → option mappings, the Hinglish / low-literacy layer |
| `config/consent-scopes.yaml` | The five consent scopes and their audio scripts |
| `config/policy.yaml` | ABAC roles, purposes and actions |
| `data/terminology/*.json` | CodeSystems (ICD-11 subset, NAMASTE, Dashavidha) and reference ranges |

Terminology content is **data**, never code. No medical code string is written at a call site.

## Layout

```
app/
  contracts/     provenance.py (the tiers), history.py (ClinicalHistory), record.py (THE CHOKE POINT),
                 projection.py (ledger -> history), no_diagnosis.py
  modules/
    dialogue/    Module A — ontology loader, deterministic machine, answers, voice
    documents/   Module B — OCRBackend protocol + 2 impls, entities, ranges, timeline, pipeline
    summary/     Module C — assemble, prose, traceability (the gate), generate
    consent/     Module D — consent, session lifecycle + purge, HIS push
  redflags/      the rule engine (Invariant 3)
  llm/           protocol, schemas, offline rule extractor, groq, registry, extraction
  speech/        protocol + local / client / groq_whisper / bhashini backends
  terminology/   guard.py (ported: emit_coding), store.py, sidecar.py
  fhir/          r4.py (R4B models, stamped 4.0.1), bundle.py, outcomes.py
  auth/ audit/   ported from SIH 25026 — see docs/PORTED.md
  api/           33 endpoints
eval/            50 gold scripts + 12 held-out + runner + OCR benchmark
frontend/src/    kiosk/ (patient) and physician/ (review) — one component per file
```

## Commands

```bash
make setup        # venv + pip + npm
make demo         # API + frontend, one command, no Docker needed
make test         # 180+ tests
make lint         # ruff + mypy + tsc, all must be clean
make eval         # 50 gold scripts + 12 held-out + the gap between them
make check        # lint + test + eval-strict — run before committing
```

Python is **plain `venv` + `pip`** (no uv, no poetry). SQLite by default so everything runs
with no Docker and no network.

## Conventions

- **One component per file** in the frontend. The user customises pieces independently.
- **camelCase on the wire, snake_case in Python.** Enforced at the API boundary by
  `api_dump()`. If a field arrives snake_case in the frontend, that is a backend bug — do not
  add a mapping layer.
- **An ADR for every non-obvious decision**, in `docs/adr/`, in the style of ADR-0002.
- **Commit at every phase boundary**, and say in the message whether you reached for a rule or
  the LLM, and why.
- **`ruff` and `mypy` clean at every phase.** Not "mostly clean".

## Out of scope — do not build

No diagnosis, no triage-to-specialty routing, no treatment suggestion. No real patient data
ever — synthetic fixtures only. No kiosk hardware integration. No production ABDM credentials
(the mock IdP stands in). No hospital HIS vendor integration beyond the documented FHIR
endpoint and its stub receiver.
