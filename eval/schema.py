"""The gold-script contract.

A script is a synthetic patient and everything we expect the system to get right about them.
It is deliberately verbose: `expected` names the exact slot values, and `expected_red_flags`
names the exact rule ids. A script that says "should detect an emergency" is not scoreable.

Written by hand, not generated. A generated gold set measures how well the system reproduces
the generator, which is a number that always looks good and means nothing.
