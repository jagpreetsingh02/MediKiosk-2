"""The database fallback cannot come back.

The recurring failure this file exists to prevent is not a crash. It is a *success*: the
application starts, the browser works, a whole consultation is recorded — into a local SQLite
file, while the Supabase tables everyone is watching stay empty. Nothing fails, nothing warns,
and the bug is visible only as absence. That failure mode has three separate causes and this
module pins the fix for each:

  1. `database_url` had a SQLite default, so a missing or misspelled DATABASE_URL still
     produced a working application.
  2. The Postgres check was opt-in, behind a REQUIRE_SUPABASE flag that defaulted to off.
  3. The check was skipped whenever `environment == "test"` — an ordinary config value that a
     developer could set in `.env` and disable the guard for their whole machine.

The tests below fail the build if any of the three returns. They deliberately assert on the
*absence* of a capability, which is the only way to test that something cannot happen.
