"""The patient reads back what OCR found on their own paper, before it counts.

Two things are proved here. First, that a *named* human correction reaches the ledger — it
did not before this slice, and the lane reported success anyway. Second, that the patient's
authority and the document's authority are different things: a patient may admit a
low-confidence reading, and may dispute a high-confidence one, but disputing does not delete
what the prescription says.
