"""Turning an answer into facts. The only bridge between the kiosk and the ledger.

Every path out of this module ends in ``record_fact()``. There is no branch that writes a
value any other way, which is why the "tapped" case is interesting: a tap has no utterance,
so what is its source? The answer is that **the label the patient read and pressed is the
source**. We record it verbatim, with ``modality=touch``. That is honestly what happened, it
renders sensibly in click-to-source ("patient selected: *Chest*"), and it means a tapped
answer is exactly as auditable as a spoken one.

Tapping is ``confirmed`` (the patient affirmed a direct, closed question). Free narration is
``stated``. Those are the two utterance tiers and they mean different things clinically: a
patient volunteering chest pain is a stronger signal than a patient agreeing that they have it.
