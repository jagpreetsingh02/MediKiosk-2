"""Module A — the deterministic dialogue state machine.

**The LLM never decides what to ask next.** This file decides, by walking the ontology in
order and evaluating `ask_if` conditions against facts already recorded. Given the same
ledger it produces the same next question every single time, and it keeps working with the
network unplugged, the Groq key revoked, and the model deprecated.

The LLM has exactly two jobs elsewhere in Module A:

* `app/llm/extraction.py` — pull slot values out of a free-text utterance (Phase 2);
* `app/llm/phrasing.py`   — say this question's fixed intent in more natural words (Phase 2).

Neither can change the question order, skip a question, add a question, or end the interview.
`tests/test_machine_is_deterministic.py` runs the whole interview with the LLM stubbed to
raise, and asserts an identical transcript.
