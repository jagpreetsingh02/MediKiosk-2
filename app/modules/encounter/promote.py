"""⛔ Promotion — the one path from a capture session into the durable record.

The ordering here is the whole point, and it is the reason `IntakeSession` was not simply
renamed `Encounter`:

    validate the draft is fully traceable
        └─▶ create or find the Patient
              └─▶ create the durable Encounter
                    └─▶ persist facts, evidence, medications, observations,
                        documents, timeline, red flags, the decision
                          └─▶ commit
                                └─▶ ONLY NOW purge the capture session

`promote()` does not purge. It returns, the caller commits, and the caller purges. A purge
that ran before the promotion committed would destroy a patient's visit on any failure after
it — and a half-promoted encounter is worse than a lost one, because it looks complete.

Medication status is the other load-bearing decision. A prescription found in a document is
`documented`; a patient saying they take something is `patient-reported-current`; the same
medicine seen in a *previous* encounter and not mentioned today stays `historical`. Nothing
here concludes that a medicine is currently being taken because it was once prescribed.
