"""Expiring guest records, and everything that hangs off them.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Guest mode writes real rows into the real schema, and only an explicit Reset
removed them. Every judge who pressed Try Demo left a patient with six encounters, its facts,
its evidence and its documents behind — permanently, on a free-tier database with a hard
storage cap. That is a slow leak with a definite end date.

⛔ `DELETE FROM patient` IS NOT ENOUGH, and the schema is what says so.

Most of the record does cascade: encounter, clinical_fact, source_evidence, document_record,
extracted_entity, medication_event, observation_event, timeline_event, physician_decision,
red_flag_event, contradiction_record, report_snapshot, patient_identifier — all ON DELETE
CASCADE from patient or encounter.

THREE TABLES DO NOT, because they belong to the CAPTURE side and are keyed by `session_ref`
rather than by a foreign key to the patient:

    consent_record      the proof consent was given
    intake_session      the capture session itself
    submitted_bundle    what was pushed to the stub HIS

A guest who actually runs an intake creates all three. Deleting only the patient leaves them
orphaned — rows referencing a session whose encounter no longer exists, invisible to every
join and impossible to attribute. So the sweep walks
`encounter.source_session_ref` first and clears them explicitly.

⛔ AUDIT EVENTS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT DELETED. `audit_event` is a HASH-CHAINED log (Invariant
6): each row carries the hash of the one before it, and `GET /api/v1/audit/verify` walks the
chain. Removing entries from the middle breaks verification for every entry after them —
turning a tamper-evident log into one that reports tampering. The rows hold references and
action names, not clinical content, and a demo session's audit trail is exactly the kind of
thing an auditor should still be able to see. Retention beats tidiness here.

NEVER TOUCHES A CLINICAL RECORD. Every statement is scoped by `is_synthetic = true` AND the
`pat_guest_` prefix — two independent conditions, because this deletes cascading rows and the
cost of being wrong is unrecoverable. `tests/test_guest_sweep.py` asserts a mislabelled real
patient still cannot be swept.
