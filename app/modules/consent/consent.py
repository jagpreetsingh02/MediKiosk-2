"""Granular, revocable, audio-explained consent — Invariant 6, first half.

Consent is a **gate**, not a checkbox: `FactLedger.consent_scopes` is populated from the grant,
and `record_fact()` refuses any fact whose `required_scope` is not in it. Refusing the voice
scope does not disable a warning; it makes the microphone path structurally unable to write.

Three properties enforced here:

* **Granular.** Five independent scopes. Refusing `documents` does not affect `history`.
* **Revocable.** `revoke()` narrows the ledger's scopes immediately. Facts already recorded
  under a since-revoked scope are purged, because consent withdrawn is consent withdrawn.
* **Audio-explained.** Every scope carries `audio_en`/`audio_hi` written for someone who has
  never used a computer. `grant()` records *whether the audio was actually played*, and the
  physician screen shows a consent that was granted without it having been played.
