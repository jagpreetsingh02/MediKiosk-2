"""Sign in / register — A STUB, and labelled as one everywhere it appears.

⛔ WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not an authentication system, and nothing in the product depends on
it. The real identity path is the MOCK ABHA IdP in `app/auth/mock_idp.py`, which is a
documented project decision (`AGENT.md`, ADR notes, `/about`) and is NOT being replaced with
Supabase Auth — inventing a second, conflicting patient identity is exactly what the brief
refuses. This exists so the judged product does not have a conspicuous hole where a sign-in
screen would be.

Being a stub is not a licence to model bad security, because a stub is what people copy:

  * NO USER ENUMERATION. "No such user" and "wrong password" return the SAME message and the
    same status. A login form that distinguishes them is a free list of who holds an account,
    and it is the single most common way a real system leaks its user base.
  * RATE LIMITED. Per-identifier and per-client, in-process. It is not a distributed limiter
    and does not claim to be, but an endpoint with no limit at all teaches the wrong shape.
  * CONSTANT-TIME COMPARISON, and a hash computed even when the account does not exist, so
    the response time does not answer the question the message refuses to.
  * NOTHING IS STORED. There is no user table. Registration accepts and returns a stub
    response; it does not create an account, and it says so.
