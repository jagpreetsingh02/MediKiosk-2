"""The offline backend: a deterministic, rule-based extractor that satisfies the LLM protocol.

This exists because a hackathon demo must not depend on a network, and because it makes the
"does the LLM actually help?" question measurable — `eval/` runs the same 50 scripts through
both backends and reports the delta. If the delta is small, that is a finding worth reporting,
not an embarrassment to hide.

It is a keyword-and-pattern matcher over the ontology's own option labels. It will never
extract something the deterministic path could not, and it never invents a quote: every quote
it emits is a slice of the input string, taken by index.
