"""Pydantic contracts for every LLM output. The model has no unstructured surface.

Note what the extraction schema demands: a `quote` for every extracted value, which must be a
**verbatim substring of the utterance**. The model is not asked to be honest about its sources;
it is asked to produce a string that `record_fact()` will then independently verify against the
transcript. A model that invents a quote fails the check and its extraction is dropped.
