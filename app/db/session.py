    `pg_net` extension, and one of the long-idle connections observed belongs to it. A role
    setting would reap Supabase's infrastructure along with our orphans. The blast radius
    is not ours to take.

    WHY NOT `server_settings` on connect — tried first, and it silently does not work
    through the pooler: Supavisor swallows startup parameters, so `idle_session_timeout`
    came back as 0 and `application_name` as "Supavisor". A `SET` issued after the
    connection is established does stick, because session mode gives us one backend for the
    life of the connection.

    The `application_name` is not cosmetic either. Our connections previously appeared in
    `pg_stat_activity` with an empty name, indistinguishable from anything else on the
    `postgres` role, which is a large part of why the connection budget was hard to reason
