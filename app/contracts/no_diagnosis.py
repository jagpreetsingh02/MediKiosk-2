"""⛔ Invariant 1 — the system never diagnoses.

Two enforcement points:

1. **Shape.** ``ClinicalHistory`` has no assessment-shaped field, and
   ``tests/test_invariant_no_diagnosis.py`` scans the contract module for one.
2. **Wire.** :func:`assert_no_assessment` runs over every outbound clinical payload in
   ``app/api``. A field named ``differential`` cannot reach a client even if someone adds it
   to a dict along the way.

The check is on *field names and shapes*, not on prose: the patient is free to say "the doctor
told me I have diabetes", and that is recorded as reported history under ``past_medical``. The
line is that MediKiosk never *originates* an assessment of its own.
