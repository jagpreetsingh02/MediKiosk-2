"""⛔ ``record_fact()`` — THE CHOKE POINT. Invariant 2 lives or dies here.

Nothing in this codebase writes a clinical fact except through this function. It refuses:

* a fact with no source span;
* a fact whose span text does not actually contain what is being recorded, when the value is
  a string (a paraphrase is not a source) — a *named* human reading of an OCR span counts
  as span text, which is how a verified correction gets in;
* a fact whose tier disagrees with its span class (``document`` tier with an utterance span);
* a ``confirmed`` fact that names no question — "the patient affirmed" is meaningless without
  saying what they were asked;
* a value at a path the ontology does not define, so a typo cannot invent a clinical field;
* anything at all on a session whose consent scope does not cover it.

``tests/test_record_fact_is_the_only_writer.py`` scans the source tree and fails if
``Fact(`` is constructed anywhere else. There is no ``force=`` parameter and no bypass. Do not
add one — the absence is the feature.
